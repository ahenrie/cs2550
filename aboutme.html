    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I really love linux. I have been using it for years as my main OS. I love being able to change and customize every
      thing about my computer. That being said, I have broken my OS multiple times and I will again!

      I am also very much into fishing. I love to fish! It has been a way for me to metidate and relax for years. I do not
      care if I get so much as a nibble when I am fishing. It is all about the journey.

      Reading has been something that I have a love hate realtionship with. Growing up with dyslexia, I was never able to read very
      well or quick. It drove me nuts. I decided to pick up reading on and off throughout the years to help.
